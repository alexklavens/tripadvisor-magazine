What a wonderful experience. The old train is kept in pristine condition and the decor and ambience transports you to another time in years gone by. It is expected that passengers dress smartly and I was disappointed to see some people getting on in Jeans and T-shirts. My husband and I went the whole hog and dressed up to the nines in 1950s style I even made him wear a fedora and grow a clark gable type moustacheI For my part I had the pill box hat and appropriate suit. All this was very much appreciated by the waiters and the service provided to us was first class. It was actually said to us by 2 or 3 of the waiters that "it was nice to see people who have bothered". We boarded the train at Victoria and shortly after were served a very nice lunch. The food was a little disappointing as there wasn\'t a great choice and none of the choices available were really to my liking but nevertheless I wanted to make the best of the trip and ordered what I thought I\'d like and it was fine. It was served beautifully on lovely china and was hot. We disembarked from this train to travel through the tunnel and this was done whilst on a coach. On arrival in France we were shown to another Pullman and on this train, although we were not sleeping on the train, we were given our own "room". I have to say I\'m glad we were not scheduled to sleep on the train as the cabins are extremely small and I\'ve heard (from a friend) sleeping is very uncomfortable. However, the cabin was more than adequate for what we required, i.e., to change for dinner. Evening dress is expected and most people did change but always there will be a few who don\'t "go with the flow". Drinks were served in the bar before (and after) dinner. Walking along the carriages is a bit precarious so don\'t try it holding a drink ! The meal in the evening was superb. I have to say that the actual main course shown on the menu was Lamb and I don\'t eat lamb at all. I pointed this out and was immediately asked if I would like a steak. I agreed and it was absolutely delicious. After dinner you can sit in the bar or go to your room (if you have one). Our journey ended about at hour after dinner and we disembarked at Paris. The train then goes on to Venice. All in all I found the whole experience enchanting and I feel with something like this, you get more out of it, the more you yourself put into it. I don\'t know if I would do it again, I think having done it once, I\'m content with that, but I am so glad I have had this experience and I would certainly recommend anyone to do it.
